# Movies--ETL
Repo for Module 8 Challenge

PURPOSE
The purpose of the following assesment is to evaluate how inegration across multiple databases; Wiki, MovieLens and Kaggle metadata is posible by means of the ETL process while using a PostgreSQL which allows for relational database management while mainting precision and ease of executabilty to ensure for smooth data recovering and symplifying command input.

DELIVERABLE 1 FINDINGS

By means of the ETL process data was displayed as a frame to ease interpretation while recovering the requested variable; emphasis on the READ process to ensure data consistency.

DELIVERABLE 2 FINDINGS

ETL continuity emphasizing EXTRACTION AND TRANSFORMATION (WIKI) of data, preparation, function writing, filtering and cleaning.

DELIVERABLE 3 FINDINGS

ETL continuity emphasizing EXTRACTION AND TRANSFORMATION (KAGGLE) of data, preparation, function writing, filtering and cleaning.


DELIVERABLE 4 FINDINGS

DATABASE CREATION - Code refactoring for instruction simplifying which allows for consistency throughout and precision.

With the summary obtained before we can obtain patterns and relationships to determine the best choice of genre, budget, year and several key aspects of a film.
Data analysis requires for systematically applied knowledge to pinpoint specific data and most of all to ensure consistency, by the means of the aforementioned deliverables; examination, recovering, and arranging the display of 6048 movies with simplicity and accuracy the user is on a more consistent way of determining the best choice for selecting a movie.
